# Splitting WordPress Posts in Multi pages

```
Dividing your posts into two or more pages is surprisingly simple.

In the post editor, switch to “Text” mode rather than “Visual” mode and add the following tag wherever you want to split your post:

<!--nextpage-->

You can add this tag anywhere you want as many times as you want.
```

```
/*
* PHP Code for WordPress
*/
wp_link_pages();
```
